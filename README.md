# Festract

Festract is a Node.js application that builds Spotify playlists based on your music festival of choice. Sample the sounds of an upcoming festival, or pretend you were at a past festival. The choice is yours.

It uses [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) to read artist names from festival lineup images, and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to find each artist's top track and create the resulting playlist.
